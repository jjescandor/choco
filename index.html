            <p><b>For the fig-swirl:</b> Melt butter over medium head in a saucepan. Add brown sugar and stir to
                dissolve.
                Halve all of the figs and toss in the saucepan with water and lemon juice. Cook over medium heat,
                stirring frequently, until you have a chunky-jammy mixture. Add salt with one or two stirs, set aside
                and let cool completely.</p>
            <p><b>Ice cream:</b>In a small pot over medium heat, combine milk, and granulated sugar until is completely
                dissolved and the milk is just barely lukewarm. Whisk in the eggs yolks. Set mixture in the fridge and
                wait until the mixture is cooled.</p>
            <p>Using ice cream machine, pour liquids into frozen basin and process according to manufacturer
                instructions, i.e., let spin and thicken for 20 minutes before adding mascarpone, fig jam mixture, and
                the nuts. Continue to process for +/- 10 minutes. Pour semi-frozen mixture into a pyrex dish or glass
                tupperware. Freez for at least two hours before serving.</p>
